# ML-Weapon-Recognition

Gun related deaths continue to pose a threat to public
safety in the United States, with over 46,000 deaths
reported in 2023 alone. In response to growing security
concerns, surveillance technologies have become increasingly
widespread; however, the effectiveness of these systems is
hindered by human limitations. Research shows that continuous monitoring of CCTV footage leads to visual fatigue
and a significant decrease in detection accuracyâ€“ leading
to a failure rate of up to 83% after just 40 minutes of
continuous monitoring. These findings highlight a critical
need for automated tools for threat detection. This project
uses deep learning techniques for detection of weapons from
CCTV footage. Specifically, we explore YOLO frameworks to
detect firearms and knives in still images derived from video
surveillance. We aimed to maintain a high level of accuracy
while prioritizing speed for real-time deployment.
